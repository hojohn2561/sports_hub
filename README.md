# Sports Hub
The second iteration of <a href="https://github.com/hojohn2561/fantasy_sports_hub">this project</a>, this time, using just Django as the tech stack, instead of React + Django REST. 
And instead of using SportRadar's API, this application web scrapes and offers stats, highlights, and scores for sporting events, in a easily understandable U.I. with an eye towards being a useful fantasy tool.
